"function_minimization_multiple_parameters" --> defines some input function composed of two parameters, plots function on 3D axes to inform initial parameter guesses, then executes scipy.optimize.minimize on this function with x0 initial params with two chief outputs: x_min, y_min, and f(x_min,y_min). Final output is this precise 3D figure of the function, along with a prominent data point representing the approximated minimum of the function.
